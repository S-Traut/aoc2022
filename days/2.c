/*
Advent Of Code 2022 - StÃ©phane Traut
DAY 2

For this solution I've used some const arrays to find the right answer to play
This might be improved especially for the MAPPINGS constants

The technique is simple: there is an array RULES that defines what you score using a 2D array
E.G if your enemy play R which is 0 and you play P which is 1 the result is simple RULES[0][1] => 8

For the second part, I created a similar array which store what you should play and combine both
RULES and PLAY at the end to get the correct score.

const char RULES[3][3] = {
    {4, 8, 3},
    {1, 5, 9},
    {7, 2, 6},

    // Extract line inputs
